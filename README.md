Hi, my name is Liang-Yu Lumos Chen, holding a Masterâ€™s degree in Biometry division of department of agronomy from National Taiwan University. My expertise includes statistical modeling, experimental design, and data analysis, with research focused on training set optimization for genomic selection. This work allowed me to handle large-scale, high-dimensional datasets and transform complex information into actionable insights.
Beyond academics, I actively pursued practical machine learning applications. I ranked 47th out of 868 teams in the 2025 SinoPac AI GO stock prediction competition, applying Python LightGBM, XGBoost, and scikit-learn for feature engineering, model building, and handling imbalanced data. I am also leading the development of an R package, overseeing system design and GitHub project management, demonstrating strong collaboration and project leadership.
Previously, I worked at Horng-Shee Tai-Ping Golf Course, where I was responsible for turfgrass management, including irrigation, pesticide application, and mowing. I also participated in ESG-related workshops and managerial conferences. This experience deepened my understanding of data-driven decision-making in business contexts.
I am logical, efficient, and collaborative, with the ability to not only build models but also interpret results into practical business insights. I look forward to applying my skills in data analytics, customer behavior prediction, and business optimization, contributing to impactful decision-making in industry.
